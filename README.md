DJECOMMERCE


most of the work needid in this project is backend side, we are using python and django

uptil now we work with setting up static files for this project and loading them in html home.page

I made changes for only home.html so it might be possible, other pages not work in the way we want, I just started work on this project, so in comming commits I keep on developing this project...
